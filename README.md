Netflix Data

Practice with:
pandas for dataframe manipulation
for loops
scatterplots with matplotlip (within for loop)
list comprehention


Improvements:
Would like to check why data is missing from the 'genres' plot compared to the 'all movies' plot. 
better way of plotting the graphs into a subplot so they can all be viewed toget. I suspect this would be easier if they were not generated in the for loop.
